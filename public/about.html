<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Richelle De Castro, and I’m so excited to share a little slice of my life with you. I’m 30 years old, and I’ve always been passionate about finding beauty and joy in the small things that make life special. Two of my favorite things are making scented candles and bead bracelets—they’re not just objects to me but little pieces of art and comfort that spark happiness and creativity.</p>

<p>Scented candles are my go-to for creating cozy, peaceful spaces. Whether it’s the warm scent of vanilla, the refreshing scent of Fresh Bamboo, something unique, candles bring calm and inspiration into my life. On the other hand, bead bracelets hold a special place in my heart because of their versatility and personal touch. Each piece tells a story—of colors, textures, and meaning—that can brighten anyone’s day.
<p>Through my website, I hope to share not just my passions but also my journey of creativity and mindfulness. Whether you’re here to find inspiration, explore unique ideas, or simply connect with someone who loves the little things in life, you’re in the right place.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by! I hope my world brings a spark of joy to yours.</p>
