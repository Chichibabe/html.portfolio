<h1>Best movie according to Richelle</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies / show of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Emily in Paris</h3>
<p>What I love in this show is, Emily's journey navigating cultural differences and her career adds relatable touch for viewers. And I love how positive she really is in life.</p>

<h3>Maleficent</h3>
<p>I love how Maleficent reimagines the villain as a complex, relatable character. The emotional journey, stunning visuals, and Maleficent’s bond with Aurora make it a beautiful story of love and redemption.</p>

<h3>Old Guard</h3>
<p>
    The Old Guard (both the movie and the comic) is captivating because of its compelling mix of immortality, action, and humanity. What I love the most is how it delves into the emotional toll of immortality—how the characters grapple with loss, loneliness, and the weight of centuries of experiences.
<p>

Charlize Theron as Andy stands out for her layered portrayal of a weary leader trying to keep her team together. The deep bond among the immortal characters, especially Joe and Nicky’s heartwarming relationship, adds depth and emotional resonance to the action-packed storyline.
<p>
    Also, the fight choreography is incredible—fluid and brutal, showing the team’s centuries of battle-hardened expertise. Plus, the twist of a modern betrayal and the introduction of a new immortal like Nile brings a fresh perspective into their timeless existence.</p>
